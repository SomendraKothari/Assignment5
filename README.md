In First code, first I import re module to use all the regex functions, then created a dictionary with keys as students name and values as their marks. Then took user input for a name to be searched in that dictionary. Then used "findall" function to find the occurance of the name entered by giving the name and dictionary type casted into string. Then used if-else so that if the name matches a key , the value at that key in dictinary should be printed for which I used the 0th index of the outupt of findall function which returns a list so that I can get that exact key name. Else printed that it does not exist.

In second code, I first imported random module as I wanted to make a list with random numbers as its elements and used randint function from it. In the empty list I added 10 numbers by append function. Then took another empty list in which I stored 1st five elements of previous list using for loop. Then to reverse the list, I used sort(reverse=true) function and printed that particular list.
